# Technical Architecture & Design Decisions

This document explains the key architectural decisions made in the AI Debate Club project, providing context for future maintainers and contributors.

## Core Architecture

### Next.js App Router

**Decision**: Use Next.js 14 App Router with TypeScript
**Rationale**:

- Server-side rendering for better SEO and initial load performance
- API routes co-located with frontend code for simpler deployment
- Built-in TypeScript support reduces runtime errors
- React 18 features like Suspense improve user experience during AI response generation

### State Management Strategy

**Decision**: React state + local storage for session persistence
**Rationale**:

- Debates are ephemeral by design—no need for complex state management
- Local storage preserves debate state during page refreshes
- Simple useState hooks are sufficient for current scope
- Avoids overhead of Redux/Zustand for this use case

## AI Integration

### Why Circuit Breaker Pattern?

**Decision**: Implement circuit breaker pattern for Groq API calls
**Rationale**:

- AI APIs can be flaky—circuit breakers prevent cascade failures
- Groq API has rate limits and occasional downtime
- Fast-fail behavior improves user experience vs. hanging requests
- Automatic recovery when service stabilizes
- Prevents resource exhaustion from retrying failed requests

**Implementation**: Custom CircuitBreaker class with configurable failure thresholds and recovery timeouts.

### Retry Logic with Exponential Backoff

**Decision**: Sophisticated retry mechanism with customizable conditions
**Rationale**:

- Network intermittency is common with external APIs
- Exponential backoff reduces server load during outages
- Custom retry conditions allow different strategies per error type
- Rate limit errors need different handling than network timeouts

### Prompt Engineering Strategy

**Decision**: Structured personas with consistent system prompts
**Rationale**:

- Token limits require concise but effective prompts
- Consistent persona behavior across debate turns
- 220-token response limit balances depth with engagement
- Clear debate rules prevent off-topic responses

## Error Handling Architecture

### Error Hierarchy Design

**Decision**: Severity-based error classification with contextual information
**Rationale**:

- Traditional error handling lacks context for debugging
- Severity levels (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, CRITICAL) enable proper alerting
- Rich context objects make errors actionable
- Inheritance chain allows specific error types while maintaining consistency

**Key Error Types**:

- `NetworkError` - Connectivity issues, usually retryable
- `AIServiceError` - Groq API problems, may need circuit breaking
- `ValidationError` - User input issues, not retryable
- `RateLimitError` - Quota exhaustion, needs backoff
- `SystemError` - Internal failures, requires investigation

### Error Factory Pattern

**Decision**: Centralized error creation with consistent metadata
**Rationale**:

- Ensures all errors have required fields (id, timestamp, context)
- Prevents scattered error construction throughout codebase
- Makes error handling patterns consistent
- Simplifies debugging with structured error information

## Testing Strategy

### Why Focus on Real-World Failures?

**Decision**: Test actual failure modes rather than chase coverage metrics
**Rationale**:

- 100% coverage often tests trivial paths, not real bugs
- AI applications have unique failure modes (rate limits, timeouts, malformed responses)
- Integration tests catch cross-component issues coverage misses
- Error handling is more critical than happy path scenarios

### Test Categories

1. **Unit Tests** - Core business logic, error types, persona configurations
2. **Integration Tests** - Cross-module interactions, retry logic with circuit breakers
3. **Component Tests** - User interactions, accessibility compliance
4. **Error Scenario Tests** - Network failures, API downtime, malformed responses

### Mock Strategy with MSW

**Decision**: Mock Service Worker for realistic API testing
**Rationale**:

- Network-level mocking more realistic than function mocking
- Easy to test different error scenarios (timeouts, 500s, rate limits)
- Works in both tests and development
- Doesn't require changes to application code

## Performance Considerations

### Cost Optimization

**Decision**: Aggressive token management for sub-$0.50/month operation
**Rationale**:

- Hobby projects need strict cost controls
- ~350 input + 220 output tokens per message = ~$0.0004 per debate
- Efficient prompt engineering reduces token waste
- Groq's competitive pricing (vs OpenAI) enables cost target

### Lighthouse Performance Testing

**Decision**: Automated performance monitoring with GitHub Actions
**Rationale**:

- AI responses can be slow—frontend performance critical for UX
- Catch performance regressions before users notice
- Accessibility compliance built into CI/CD
- Performance budgets prevent feature bloat

### Memory Management

**Decision**: No persistent storage, ephemeral debate sessions
**Rationale**:

- Reduces infrastructure complexity and costs
- Privacy-friendly—no debate content stored long-term
- Forces focus on session-based UX
- Simplifies GDPR compliance

## Deployment Architecture

### Vercel Platform Choice

**Decision**: Vercel for hosting with automatic GitHub deployments
**Rationale**:

- Seamless Next.js integration with zero configuration
- Edge functions provide global low-latency for API routes
- Automatic deployments reduce deployment friction
- Built-in performance monitoring and analytics

### CI/CD Pipeline Design

**Decision**: Multi-stage pipeline with quality gates
**Rationale**:

- Prevent broken code from reaching production
- TypeScript errors caught in pre-commit hooks
- Comprehensive test suite (152 tests) ensures reliability
- Lighthouse performance gates maintain UX quality
- Security audits catch vulnerable dependencies

### Environment Strategy

**Decision**: Environment variables for all configuration
**Rationale**:

- API keys never committed to repository
- Easy configuration across environments (dev, preview, prod)
- Vercel environment variable inheritance
- Local development with .env.local

## Code Organization

### File Structure Philosophy

**Decision**: Feature-based organization with shared utilities
**Rationale**:

- Related code stays together (debate logic, personas, API clients)
- Clear separation between UI components and business logic
- Shared utilities avoid duplication
- Easy to locate functionality for debugging

### TypeScript Strategy

**Decision**: Strict TypeScript with comprehensive type definitions
**Rationale**:

- Catch errors at compile time, not runtime
- Better IDE support and refactoring safety
- Self-documenting code through type definitions
- Prevents common JavaScript pitfalls

## Monitoring & Observability

### Logging Strategy

**Decision**: Structured logging with configurable endpoints
**Rationale**:

- Debug production issues without reproduction
- Structured logs enable automated analysis
- Configurable for different monitoring services
- Performance-aware (disabled in development)

### Error Tracking

**Decision**: Rich error context with unique identifiers
**Rationale**:

- Every error gets unique ID for tracking
- Context includes user actions and system state
- Enables root cause analysis of production issues
- Supports A/B testing of error recovery strategies

## Future Considerations

### Scalability Decisions

- Current architecture handles hobby-scale traffic efficiently
- Database introduction would require significant refactoring
- Real-time features would need WebSocket or Server-Sent Events
- Multi-tenant support would require authentication system

### Extensibility Points

- New personas easily added through configuration
- Additional AI providers possible with adapter pattern
- UI themes configurable through CSS custom properties
- Internationalization prepared through TypeScript types

---

This architecture prioritizes **reliability over complexity**, **cost efficiency over features**, and **maintainability over performance optimization**. Decisions can be revisited as requirements evolve, but this foundation provides a solid base for the current scope.
